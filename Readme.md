# AI-Powered 3D Website Using React

This is a 3D website that allows users to customize a Tshirt and upload their own images to it. The website uses the OpenAI DALLE API to generate images from text captions. The website is built using React, ThreeJS, React Three Fiber, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, and ExpressJS.

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

- [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model

- [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/) - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework

- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - the most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations

- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) - a popular NodeJS framework for building web applications

### What I learned

- Load, create and customize stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as understand the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space.
- Make your code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices
- Add custom color and file support.
- Generate and use images through DALLE AI
- Ensure responsiveness across all devices and improve your site's performance
